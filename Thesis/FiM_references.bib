@article{VanWezel2001,
abstract = {The word 'planner' has two distinct meanings in literature. The first meaning refers to the profession of a human. Organizational processes must be planned so people know what work they are going to do. An example is a production planner in a factory. The second meaning of planner refers to an actor who must think about his actions before performing them, for example making a shopping list. Both connotations of planner have their own research fields. The profession of the human planner is mainly analyzed in the context of computer support. Examples of research areas are knowledge acquisition, task modeling, decision support, constraint modeling and solving, and operations research. The second meaning of planning is dealt with, for example, by psychology, semiotics, Artificial Intelligence, and robotics. Apparently, both planning worlds have their own research methodologies, languages, ontologies, and models. In this article, we describe the main schools for both fields and the apparent paradoxes that are the result of integration. Â© 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

@inproceedings{Eppinger2001,
abstract = {[Introduction] Development of complex products and large systems is a highly interactive social process involving hundreds of people designing thousands of interrelated components and making millions of coupled decisions. Nevertheless, we have created methods to study the development process, identify its underlying structures, and critique its operation. In this article, we introduce three views of product development complexity: a process view, a product view, and an organization view. We are able to learn about the complex social phenomenon of product development by studying the patterns of interaction across the decomposed elements within each view. We also compare the alignment of the interaction patterns, between the product, process, and organization domains. We then propose metrics of product development complexity by studying and comparing these interaction patterns. Finally, we develop hypotheses regarding the patterns of product development interactions, which will be helpful to guide future research.},

@article{Angell1999,
abstract = {In this polemical essay the authors ask whether computerisation has become the neurosis of our age. By comparing the application of IT methodologies with ritual behaviour within human social institutions, they propose that the so-called rationality of management science, with its tidy benchmarking, auditing, categorisation and performance measurements etc., is actually a pseudo-science. They show that from the position of Nietzschean epistemology, this rationality is merely a false claim to the instrumental efficacy of data modelling, that is indistinguishable from the rain-dancing of primitive tribes.},
